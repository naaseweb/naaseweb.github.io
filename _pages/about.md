This is the official website of the the North American Association of Sports Economists (NAASE). It includes information about association activities and resources for members. NAASE regularly sponsors sports economics sessions at the annual meetings of Western Economic Association International, Southern Economic Association, and Eastern Economic Association, but our members frequently organize event at other conferences.
