## Coates-Humphreys NAASE Distinguished Research Award
In 2025, the NAASE Executive Board conferred its inaugural research award on Dennis Coates and Brad Humphreys. The award was named in their honor to recognize not only the distinguished scholarly records of the recipients (the primary criterion for the award), but also to acknowledge their extensive contributions to NAASE,  including serving as presidents of the organization and activities connecting NAASE to sports economics communities within and outside North America. The award will be given in odd-numbered years, and the selection committee will be previous award winners and the current president of NAASE.

## Larry Hadley Service Award 

Larry Hadley was a distinguished economist and long time faculty member at the University of Dayton who helped launch the burgeoning field of sports economics. Together with Elizabeth Gustafson, he organized one of the first sessions on sports economics at the Western Economics Association (WEA) meetings in 1995. Based on the popularity of these sessions, together with the growing worldwide interest in the discipline, the WEAI currently allocates many sessions at the annual meetings to sports economics.

One result of Larry’s efforts to initiate and nurture these annual sessions was the formation of the NAASE in 2007. Beyond organizing conference activities, Larry co-edited two widely cited and popular volumes of collected papers which surveyed a number of important research topics in the field.  Larry was also a member of numerous editorial boards and scholarly associations.

NAASE created the Larry Hadley Service Award in recognition of its namesake's valuable service contributions to the field of sports economics. Originally awarded every four years, it is now presented every other year to a deserving recipient who has distinguished herself or himself through service to NAASE and the field of sports economics. Individuals can contribute to sports economics in many ways,  but this award is intended to honor those whose contributions to the community are deemed unusual and outstanding in scope and duration.

### 2018: Placido Rodriguez  ###

He is the author of numerous articles and the editor of many collected volumes on sports economics.  In addition to his economic research, he is the former president of the Real Sporting de Gijón football club.  Professor Rodriguez provided enormous service to sports economics, and has clearly distinguished himself by organizing conferences that provided researchers in the field with a venue to present their research and an opportunity to interact with other scholars and make enduring international connections that promoted development of the field.  His longstanding organization of conferences in Gijón nurtured and guided the field of sports economics.  Without his service, the field of sports economics would not be where it is today.
