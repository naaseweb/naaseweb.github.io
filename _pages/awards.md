## Larry Hadley Service Award

Larry Hadley was a distinguished economist and long time faculty member at the University of Dayton who helped launch the burgeoning field of sports economics. Together with Elizabeth Gustafson, he organized one of the first sessions on sports economics at the Western Economics Association (WEA) meetings in 1995. Based on the popularity of these sessions, together with the growing worldwide interest in the discipline, the WEAI currently allocates many sessions at the annual meetings to sports economics.

One result of Larry’s efforts to initiate and nurture these annual sessions was the formation of the NAASE in 2007. Beyond organizing conference activities, Larry co-edited two widely cited and popular volumes of collected papers which surveyed a number of important research topics in the field.  Larry was also a member of numerous editorial boards and scholarly associations.

NAASE created the Larry Hadley Service Award in recognition of its namesake's valuable service contributions to the field of sports economics. This award is given every two years to a deserving recipient who has distinguished herself or himself through service to NAASE and the field of sports economics. Individuals can contribute to sports economics in many ways,  but this award is intended to honor those whose contributions are deemed unusual and outstanding in scope and duration.
