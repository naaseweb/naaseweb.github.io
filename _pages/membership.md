NAASE membership is open to any person interested in the economics of sports. Though the formal association is new, its members include a group of economists who have been informally associated for many years. One of the goals in formalizing our ties to one another is to further expand interest in the field of sports economics. Therefore, even if you are not familiar with the field, we encourage all interested individuals to join. There are three classes of members: regular members, student members, and emeritus members.
