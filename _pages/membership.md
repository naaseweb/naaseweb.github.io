NAASE membership is open to any person interested in the economics of sports. Though the formal association is new, its members include a group of economists who have been informally associated for many years. One of the goals in formalizing our ties to one another is to further expand interest in the field of sports economics. Therefore, even if you are not familiar with the field, we encourage all interested individuals to join. There are three classes of members: regular members, student members, and emeritus members.

## Membership Benefits
NAASE members receive the Journal of Sports Economics as part of their membership representing a significant savings on the regular individual subscription rate of $131/year.

## Membership Rates
Membership is $55 per year for print and electronic access to the journal and $40 for electronic only access. Regular members may lock in today’s membership rates for up to 3 years. Members not wishing to receive the journal may contact the Treasurer for a partial refund of their membership dues.

Student memberships are $30 for one year of electronic journal access. Students should include a letter from their department verifying their student status when submitting the membership form by mail. Students making an electronic transaction must follow up their purchase by sending the department letter to the Treasurer.
