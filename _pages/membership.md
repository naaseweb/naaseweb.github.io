NAASE membership is open who anyone who is interested in the economics of sports.  Our membership is global, and includes interests and perspectives on many aspects of this sub-field. Discount memberships are available for students. 

## Membership Benefits
NAASE members receive the *Journal of Sports Economics* as part of their membership, representing a significant savings on the regular individual subscription rate of $172/year.

## Membership Rates
Regular membership is  $40/year for electronic-only access ($55 for print and electronic access), and the current annual membership fee can be locked in for up to three years. Members not wishing to receive the journal may contact the Treasurer for a partial refund of their membership dues.

Students are eligible to join NAASE for the discounted fee of $30, which includes one year of electronic access to *JSE*. When purchasing a student membership, please contact the NAASE Treasurer to verify your student status  (*e.g.*, providing a letter from a faculty advisor or school administrator).
