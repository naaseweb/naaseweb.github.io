NAASE has committed to organizing sports economics sessions at the annual meetings of three prominent scholarly associations of economists. 

- Western Economic Association International (June/July)
    - Annual NAASE membership meeting
- Southern Economic Association (November)
- Eastern Economic Association (March)

 is held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the Western Economic Association International.

 NAASE members also often organize sessions at other regional conferences (*e.g.*,  Missouri Valley Economic Association, International Atlantic Economic Society), as well as at special conferences throughout the world. We provide a list of upcoming gatherings of sports economists, along with session organizers below. Please contact a [NAASE officer](/about-us.md) if you wish NAASE to promote an upcoming meeting of sports economists that is not listed.
